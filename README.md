# Lucas Dasso - Personal Website

This is a Jekyll theme adapted for my personal website, serving as a digital hub showcasing my professional experience, artistic passions, and personal interests.

Originally based on Chester How's tale-theme (https://github.com/chesterhow/tale), this version has been customized to reflect my unique profile and provide a central point of access to my online presence.

**Key Features:**

*   **About Me:** The main page features a concise overview of my background, skills, and passions.
*   **Professional Links:** Direct links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles for exploring my professional work.
*   **Artistic Showcase:** A glimpse into my creative pursuits, including watercolors, woodworking, and more.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across various devices.

Configure Jekyll with your website title, URL, and other settings:

```yml
title: Lucas Dasso
baseurl: "" # Leave empty if your site is at the root
url: me.c238.com.ar
google_analytics: "" # Add your Google Analytics Tracking ID if you want to use it
```
