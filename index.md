# About Me

I'm Lucas Dasso, Tech Lead and Fullstack Developer at VML Argentina, with over 10 years of experience. Passionate about technology, music, painting, and woodworking, these are just a few things that bring me joy.

When I'm not coding, I'm often lost in the worlds of science fiction. I especially enjoy time paradoxes and collapsing function premises in both books and TV shows. Speaking of favorites, I'm a huge Star Trek fan (especially of [Data](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Data)!) and a devoted reader of the [Dune saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)) (<em>"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer..."</em>).

Beyond the screen and the page, I also enjoy reading ebooks and curating a digital library for my family. You can check it out at [books.c238.com.ar](books.c238.com.ar)! After all, books are wonderful!
