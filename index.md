# About Me

I'm Lucas Dasso, Tech Lead and Fullstack Developer at VML Argentina, with over 10 years of experience. Passionate about technology, music, painting, and woodworking. **These are just a few things that bring me joy**.

When I'm not coding, I'm often lost in the worlds of science fiction. I'm a huge Star Trek fan (especially of [Data](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Data)!) and a devoted reader of the [Dune saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)) (<em>"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer..."</em>). I especially enjoy time paradoxes and collapsing function premises in both scifi books and TV shows.

Also, I enjoy curating my family digital library ([check it out here](https://books.c238.com.ar/lukas238/)!). Books are just wonderful!
